# Sine Function Approximator using Neural Network

This repository contains python code for neural network which I implemented from scratch (without using scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch) to approximate the sine function

## Overview

The goal of this project is to demonstrate how a neural network can learn to approximate a continuous function. We use the sine function as a classic example due to its periodic and smooth nature.

# Sine Function Approximator using Neural Network

This repository contains a simple neural network implemented from scratch to approximate the sine function

## Overview

The goal of this project is to demonstrate how a neural network can learn to approximate a continuous function. We use the sine function as a classic example due to its periodic and smooth nature.
